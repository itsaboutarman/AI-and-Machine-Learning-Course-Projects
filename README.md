# Artificial Intelligence Course Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic projects developed for the Artificial Intelligence course at Amirkabir University of Technology. All projects are implemented in Python and demonstrate key concepts in AI and machine learning. Each project is organized into its own folder (e.g., `Project01`, `Project02`, etc.) and includes a PDF report explaining the project topic and approach.

## 🧠 Projects Overview

### 📦 [Project01 - Intelligent Agent and PEAS Analysis](./Project06)
Analyzes the concept of intelligent agents and environments using the example of a mail delivery drone. Includes modeling of the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework.

### 🔍 [Project02 - Search Algorithms](./Project02)
Implements and compares the performance of classic search algorithms:  
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
- Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)  
- A* Search  

### 👾 [Project03 - Pacman Game (Adversarial Search)](./Project03)
Implements the Pacman game using adversarial search algorithms:  
- Minimax  
- Alpha-Beta Pruning  
- Expectimax  

### 🗺️ [Project04 - Map Coloring (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)](./Project04)
Solves a classic constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) by coloring a map such that no adjacent regions have the same color.

### 👥 [Project05 - Customer Segmentation with K-Means](./Project05)
Clusters users in the **Bank** dataset using the K-Means algorithm.  
**Note:** To run this project, download the dataset via the link provided in the `PROJECT05_GUIDE.pdf` file and place it in the same directory as the project code.

### 🧬 [Project06 - Genetic Algorithm](./Project06)
Implements a basic genetic algorithm to solve an optimization problem, demonstrating concepts such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (used where applicable)

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each project folder contains:
- Python implementation files
- `Project_Guide.pdf` – Problem description
- `Project_Description.pdf` – Explanation of the implemented model
